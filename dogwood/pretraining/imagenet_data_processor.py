"""Contains the ImageNetDataProcessor class.

The ImageNet class index is taken from TensorFlow. Many pretrained models use
this ordering for ImageNet classes.

The expected directory structure for the dataset is based on this reference:
https://www.kaggle.com/ifigotin/imagenetmini-1000
The Kaggle page links to a pytorch ImageNet preprocessing script that uses the
same format, so this implementation will be applicable in many cases.
